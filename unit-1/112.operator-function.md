#### Explaining that binary operations and functions are the same

---

- Connecting two expressions (blocks) with a **binary operator** is a **binary operation**, four of which are **arithmetic operations**. This mechanism is called an **algebraic structure**.

- **Functional code can be written in the algebraic structure of mathematics**, but it's unclear how the crucial **function** is related!? And this is the cause of the mystery in functional programming, which is often glossed over in common explanations.

---

- In fact, functions are hidden in binary operations, and the **identity of the binary operator is a function**.

---

- Specifically, **the difference is only in which part of the expression the function is placed, whether symbols are used when notating, or whether alphabets are used**.

---

- In F#, a binary operator in infix notation can also be written as a function in prefix notation.

```fsharp
1 + 2 // 3
(+) 1 2 // 3
```

---

- Even in the Verse language of Unreal Editor, this is clearly explained in the **Verse Language Reference**, which feels like a reference to a functional language.

> **Operators** are special **functions** defined in the Verse programming language to perform actions such as the math operations for addition and multiplication.

---

- In other words, symbols like **$+$ or $\times$ are just another notation (SyntaxSugar) for functions, and it is the function that connects two expressions (blocks)**.

---

- Thus, **binary operators and functions are the same, just with different notation methods**. This means that we have been using something whose true identity was a function, while borrowing the form of arithmetic operations in elementary school math classes.

---

- That means, **anyone who has received elementary education understands what a function is**.

- For example, the **multiplication table is a function**. If you input the "multiplier" and the "multiplicand", you get the "answer"!

**Domain ~ Set ~ Type**

---

Later on, we will introduce that fundamentally the same concept becomes different terms depending on the field of mathematics.

| Analysis | Set Theory | Algebra | Computer Science |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Function | Mapping | Operation | (Pure) Function |
| Domain | Set | Set | Type |

> The multiplication table is a function, and the domain is integers from 1 to 9.

In this case,

The **input type of the function** called the multiplication table is,

(integer from 1 to 9, integer from 1 to 9)

- Functions are denoted as $f(x)$.

$$
f(x)
$$

---

- When it is clear that $f$ is a function of $x$, parentheses $()$ are not necessary, and it is simply denoted as $f~x$.

$$
f~x
$$

- Since it's a function, there are various ways to write it, such as addition and multiplication that are predefined and provided, or a programmer can freely design and define it. However, the binary operation $1 + 2$ is the same as applying arguments $1$ and $2$ to the **plus function** ( *let's define it with that function name for now* ).

---

- In hardcore functional languages like F# and Haskell, just by enclosing it with parentheses `(+)`, you can extract a binary operator like `+` as a function as it is, and conversely, **programmers can define their own operators**.

Here is the English translation of your text:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/web-images3/main/note.svg)

**Various ways to write $1 + 2$**

```javascript
1 + 2           // F#/Haskell/JavaScript
(+) 1 2         // F#/Haskell
plus 1 2        // F#/Haskell
plus(1)(2)      // F#/Haskell/JavaScript
```

All these notations mean the same thing. Especially the second expression, where the position of `+` has just moved to the beginning, is just a difference in mathematical notation style that humans arbitrarily decided. Even toddlers can understand `1 + 2`, but as soon as it's rewritten with `plus` instead of `+` (which was also arbitrarily decided to be that style), it suddenly feels difficult! Functional code aggressively mixes both notations, so functional code might look difficult.

The function style notation in **JavaScript** is `f(x)`, which is the notation you learn early in mathematics:

$$
f(x)
$$

The function style notation in **F#** and **Haskell** is `f x`, which does not require parentheses `()`. This is the same as the notation of trigonometric functions that you learn as you advance in mathematics, which omits parentheses:

$$
\mathrm{sin} ~ x
$$

$$
f ~ x
$$

- In hardcore functional languages like F# and Haskell, you can extract binary operators like `+` as functions just by enclosing them in `()` and conversely, **programmers can define their own operators**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ken-okabe/web-images3/main/fsharp.svg)

**Redefining arithmetic operators `+` `-` `*` `/`**

```fsharp
let (+) a b = a + b
let (-) a b = a - b
let (*) a b = a * b
let (/) a b = a / b
```

*Even if programmers don't bother to define it this way, it's already defined like this.*

---

- **Functional code is much easier to understand in the style of algebraic structures of binary operations than in function style**. This is because the style of "connecting two **blocks**" has a track record of being thoroughly trained in arithmetic from elementary school and is intuitively easy to understand.
